# Setting up your Neovim

Clone this repository into your home directory as follows:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aschuster3/nvim-dotfiles .config/nvim
```

Once everything is pulled in, run the following (also in your home directory):
```bash
~/.config/nvim/setup.sh
```

That should set it all up!

# Setting up your shell

Running the above will at least get you `brew` installed, to do other shell antics you'll
first want to switch to `zsh` and go from there.
